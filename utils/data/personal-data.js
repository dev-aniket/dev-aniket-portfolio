       description: `I’m Aniket Mallick, a Software Engineer and M.Tech. graduate in Electronics and Communication from NIT Raipur (2025), passionate about building scalable, intelligent, and user-focused web systems. At ITJOBXS, I worked across the full stack to deliver impactful solutions, including a responsive e-commerce platform that enhanced engagement and a bot-detection system that reduced spam registrations by 70%.

                    I recently developed Moodify, a cloud-deployed music streaming platform built with a microservice architecture using AWS (ECS, S3, EC2) and Google OAuth. It enables seamless artist uploads, efficient content management, and real-time multi-device synchronization. I also built Atlas, a production-grade ChatGPT-style generative AI platform powered by a RAG pipeline, real-time Socket.io communication, and an optimized backend capable of handling over 500 requests per hour.

                     With strong expertise in React, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB, I’ve solved over 600 coding challenges and ranked in the top 10% at Bhilai Hacks 2023. I focus on engineering systems that balance performance with usability — projects like MovieVerse, Moodify, and Atlas reflect my drive to turn complex ideas into smooth, scalable, and impactful user experiences.`,
